Mason Tools
=========

This is a collection of tools i use in Mason.

  - **Declared Properties:** A way to neatly set properties on parameter classes
  - **TitledSimpleInspector:** A better looking inspector allowing for titles and thus sections
  - **DataCollector:** A utitity class that collects data and is neatly inspectable
  - **DataCollectorChart:** An automatic Charting facility for the DataCollector
  - **Layout**: An automaitc Layout to fill the screen with display, console and charts
  - **Flockers**: An example using the whole Suite

Furthermore there is some scala classes to use the Properties and the Datacollector neatly from scala. As I use Scala for modelling this is more convenient. Actually Mason and Scala work nicely - maybe I'll produce an example here lateron.
